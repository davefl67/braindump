# Change unit number with ox_lib

Just a silly idea to change the unit number on police cars that happened to have multiple deliveries with multiple unit numbers.

- Create an oxlip contacts menu that allows players to choose available unit numbers for the vehicle.
- When the menu opens, it will display all the available numbers and allow selection.
- The script will change delivery on the fly.
- This should be a client-side script but I would like to have a server-side part to keep it locked to a group or use ACEs.
- Scripts would be created for each resource, housed in that folder and detailed on the manifest.
